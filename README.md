# Bee Detection

## Processing Images

### Extracting Images
1. Open the track in VLC Media player
2. Press `e` to go forward one frame
3. Once a bee going into a hole is present in the frame, press `shift + s` to capture the frame

To edit where images are saved, go to `tools -> preferences -> video -> video snapshots` and change the `Directory` variable.
